/**
 * The Amazing Labyrinth is a Java implementation of Labyrinth the
 * board game.
 *
 * Game board is formed by stationary and moving tiles of different openings,
 * thus creating a maze. There is always an extra tile, which the player can insert
 * using any of the arrows. Once the extra tile is inserted, the row or column
 * shifts and the tile that is pushed out becomes the extra tile. The player can
 * then click on a tile to move there, as long as the path is valid.
 *
 * The goal of the game is to collect all the treasures in the maze based on
 * the treasure cards shuffled and given to you.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Must insert the extra tile at beginning of turn, before you move
 *   (Note the extra tile can be rotated to your advantage)
 *
 * Areas of Improvement:
 * - Better AI
 * - Save / Load
